🧠 Character-Level RNN/LSTM Text Generator
This project implements character-level RNN and LSTM models using PyTorch to learn from the classic novel The Mysterious Island by Jules Verne (sourced from Project Gutenberg).

📁 Overview
Preprocesses text by extracting and encoding characters.

Generates training sequences using a sliding window.

Defines PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader for batching.

Implements both LSTM and RNN models for text prediction.

Trains the models and evaluates character-level accuracy.

🛠️ Dependencies
Python 3.7+

PyTorch

NumPy

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch numpy
📚 Dataset
The text is extracted from 1268-0.txt, downloaded from Project Gutenberg. The relevant content is sliced between:

sql
Copy
Edit
Start: 'THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND'  
End: 'End of the Project Gutenberg'
🧾 Preprocessing
Creates a character vocabulary (char2int and char_array)

Encodes text as integer sequences

Generates training chunks of length 41 (seq_length=40 + 1)

🧱 Model Architectures
Two models are implemented:

🔷 LSTMModel
Embedding → LSTM → Fully Connected (FC)

🟢 RNNModel
Embedding → RNN → Fully Connected (FC)

🏋️‍♂️ Training
The models are trained using:

CrossEntropyLoss

Adam optimizer

Accuracy is calculated per epoch

Run training:

python
Copy
Edit
train_model(lstm_model, model_type='lstm')
train_model(rnn_model, model_type='rnn')
💾 Model Checkpoints
Saved models:

lstm_model.pth

rnn_model.pth

You can reload and fine-tune them using:

python
Copy
Edit
lstm_loaded.load_state_dict(torch.load('lstm_model.pth'))
⚡ Sample Output
Example sequence mapping:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Input:  'THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced b'
Target: 'HE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by'
🖥️ Hardware
Automatically uses CUDA if available:

python
Copy
Edit
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
📌 Notes
Consider converting text_chunks to a single NumPy array before torch.tensor() for better performance.

Sequence generation and sampling (text generation) can be added for further exploration.
